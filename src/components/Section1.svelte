    <h1>Why even get a tattoo?</h1>
        
      <p>Here are some examples of paragraphs.</p>

        <p>
        You should wrap your text in a container with a maximum height and the
        margin set to "0 auto". That way, it's centered on the screen and looks
        like a nice column.
     </p>

     <p>
        Here's a new paragraph. These p tags automatically have some space in
        between them. You can make some of your text <strong
            >bold, like this</strong
        >. Or italics, <i>like this</i>. Maybe you want to include a link to an
        external source, you could do that
        <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/">like this</a>.
        </p>
