    <h1>The Whattado of Tattoos</h1>
        
      <p>Welcome to an illustrious inked-up experience. In it, you will find the question 
        <i><span style="color: #983628">why</span></i> sprout into mind quite often. That is to be expected.</p>

        <p>Begin with this <span style="color: #983628">why</span> : why do people cover themselves in ink and in art?</p>
        <p>
            <span style="color: #983628">Why</span> do people cover their skin with faces
             and flowers, with hearts and small doves? Is it love? Is it tradition? Is it
              something more, or perhaps something much less? The answers to those questions are
               up to you.
     </p>

     <p>
        We have below compiled a randomness of observations and investigations 
        relating to all things tattooed. We enlist these short excerpts and stories to 
        provide you a chance to consider what the purpose of a tattoo is, what their orgins are, and <span style="color: #983628">why</span> today 
        they have become widespread, popular, cool, inspirational, respectable, meaningless, 
        and fun. 
        </p>


      <p>
        We ourselves will not be your guide, our friend the illustrated humanoid 
        will take good care of you. And maybe at the end, we will reveal ourselves to you all.
         Who knows? We’ll see.
        </p>
       
        <p>
            Go now, go. To the humanoid below.
