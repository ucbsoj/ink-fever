    <h1>Why even get a tattoo?</h1>
        
      <p>Welcome to an illustrious inked-up experience. In it, you will find the question 
        <i> why </i> sprout into mind quite often. That is to be expected.</p>

        <p>Why get tattooed?</p>
        <p>
            Why do they cover themselves in ink and art? Why do people cover it with faces
             and flowers, with hearts and small doves? Is it love? Is it tradition? Is it
              something more, or perhaps something much less? The answers to those questions are
               up to you.
     </p>

     <p>
        We have below compiled a randomness of observations and investigations 
        relating to all things tattooed. In our humbleness, we do not offer any meaningful 
        conclusions or arguments, pushing you the adventurer into taking some answer away from 
        this journey. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead, we enlist the help of several short excerpts and stories to 
            provide you a chance to consider what the purpose of a tattoo is, and why today 
            they have become widespread, popular, cool, inspirational, respectable, meaningless, 
            and fun. 
            </p>

      <p>
        We ourselves will not guide you, our friend will, an illustrated humanoid who we believe 
        will take good care of you, maybe at the end, we will introduce ourselves to you all.
         Weâ€™ll see.
        </p>
       
        <p>
            Go now, go. To the humanoid below.
